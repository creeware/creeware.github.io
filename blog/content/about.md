# Team Powerline
## Creeware
Team Powerline's Creeware allows the automated testing of git management skills. It uses scheduled challenges and instantaneous feedback to provide a well paced learning schedule that covers the most basic uses of git to the most advanced.

Lecturers can establish a schedule, provide challenges and invite many students to participate in the course without being obligated to provide feedback to every student's attempts.

Students gain genuine examples of the kind of manipulations and management git repositories require. The service slowly guides them from simpler to more complex examples. Feedback is offered after every submission meaning students never have to be unsure of where their skills need to be improved and do not have down time waiting for teacher feedback.
